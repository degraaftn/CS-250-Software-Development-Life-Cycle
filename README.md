How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is a matter of empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and try to imagine what value they get out of the feature that they ask for, and make sure to get clarification from the user when you don't understand something. Implementing those needs into a program is a matter of breaking down the features into individual actions that must be taken by the user and the desired results of those actions. User stories are a tool that helps to start that process by identifying the user - "As a..." - identifying an action and result - "I want to be able to..." - and identifying the value of the feature - "so that...". 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach as a yet green developer is fairly rudimentary: I identify the requirements of the program first, then tackle a flowchart to visualize the dependencies of each function. From there I can prioritize the most important parts of the program and write pseudocode for those parts, saving the design of the less important parts for later, when I have good idea of what the core of the program will be like. Then I just get started coding.

If nothing else, I will definitely be incorporating the concept of a Product Backlog into all areas of my life where productivity is important. I already had a similar system of writing down tasks and taking them on in order of importance, but now that process will be more refined. I think I will also find the practice of timeboxing and the whole Sprint system to be extremely useful in my writing and in managing my house. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development is the same as being a good team member - effective, productive, and uplifting - in any setting. It requires taking responsibility and taking initiative - onwership, in other words. It requires honesty, openness, and even vulnerability in communication with the rest of the team in order to build trust and investment in one another. It means being consistent and reliable. It means letting go of your ego and graciously accepting constructive criticism, and constantly striving to improve.
